### Hi, I'm Mandy <img src="https://gifdb.com/images/high/cute-waving-hand-animation-22zusg2o5sgv5wac.gif" width="40">

I'm a React Developer and Designer. 

I specialize in creating user-focused and accessible websites. Leveraging a decade of experience in managing digital preservation projects and creating digital resources for museums and archives, I deliver solutions that are not only visually appealing but also user-friendly and sustainable. I'm also the Executive Director of a non-profit that builds web apps for other non-profits ~ Check out <a href="https://www.visualarchives.org">Visual Archives</a>!

I post everything I'm working on to my Github, both professional jobs and projects I'm experimenting with as I learn new frameworks.

Check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hartmandy">Linkedin</a> for live versions of my projects - under projects, certificates, jobs, etc.
